The codes are for simulations in the paper arXiv:2110.12347.

Simulation 1 (Synthetic data): The code "./Simul1_err_comm/main.m" corresponds to the left panel of Figure 1 (in that paper). Under the folder "./Simul1_comm_kappa_beta/", "main.m" generates results, and "result_figures.m" correspond to mid and right panel of Figure 1.

Simulation 2 (COV1): Under the folder "./Simul2_COV1/", "main.m" generates results, "result_figure1.m" and "result_figure2.m" are for the left and right panel of Figure 2.

Simulation 3 (MNIST): Under the folder "./Simul3_MNIST/", "main.m" generates results, "result_figure1.m" is for the left panel of Figure 3, and "result_figure2.m" is for the mid and right panel.

Simulation 4 (HIGGS): Under the folder "./Simul4_HIGGS/", "main.m" generates results, "result_figure1.m" is for the left panel of Figure 4, and "result_figure2.m" is for the left and right panel.

Simulation 5 (SUSY): Under the folder "./Simul4_SUSY/", "main.m" generates results, "result_figure1.m" is for the left panel of Figure 5, and "result_figure2.m" is for the left and right panel.
